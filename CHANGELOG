== 0.5.23 / 2012-09-14

  * New Features

    * No longer rescue Object, and instead rescue Standard Error.
      If this is a problem strange non-StandardErrors should be wrapped. (pboling - Peter Boling)

    * Refactor Panel error handling. (pboling - Peter Boling)

      Create error handling method: `handle_error_for(method_name, exception)`
        Logs the error.
        Returns HTML for the view.
        Simplifies error handling in any panel that overrides one of:
          content, heading, content_for_request and heading_for_request
        like this:

          def content
            # Do stuff
          rescue StandardError => ex
            handle_error_for(method_name, ex)
          end

== 0.5.22 / 2012-09-14

  * New Features

    * Improve handling of decoding and marshalling problems with new config options and implementation: (pboling - Peter Boling)

      :database => a hash.  Keys :raise_encoding_errors, and :raise_decoding_errors are self explanatory
                   :raise_encoding_errors
                       When set to true, if there is an encoding error (unlikely)
                       it will cause a 500 error on your site.  !!!WARNING!!!
                   :raise_decoding_errors
                       The bundled panels should work fine with :raise_decoding_errors set to true or false
                       but custom panel implementations may prefer one over the other
                       The bundled panels will capture these errors and perform admirably.
                       Site won't go down unless a custom panel is not handling the errors well.

== 0.5.17 / 2012-09-13 - Peter Boling

  * New Features

    * MagicInsight!  WARNING: Magic is dangerous.

      * MagicInsight is a new mixin that can be used by any 'stat' type class built for Rack::Bug / LogicalInsight / Rack::Insight.
        Just include Rack::Insight::MagicInsight in your stat class and then to render call:

            render_template 'magic_panel', :magic_insights => your_stat_object, :name => 'panel name'

        Read the source for Rack::Insight::MagicInsight and heed the warnings.
        MagicInsight is used internally by Rack::Insight for magic panels and the templates panel.

    * panel content now stays out of your page content, by displaying below it.

  * Bug Fixes

    * Fixed the hardly working TemplatesPanel (Issue 1)
    * Correct logging/debug statements
    * Better tracking of which panels are probing

  * Other

  * New Features

    * Panel level configuration options for all panels, including extension gems.
      Currently this is implemented in the log_panel, and configured as:
        Rack::Insight::Config.configure do |config|
          config[:panel_configs][:log_panel] = {:watch => {'Logger' => :add}}
        end

  * New Features

    * Extension gems now automatically look for their view templates
      relative to the panel class file that tries to render them.
    * Two levels of log verbosity filtering to allow re-use of the Rails log, but to not force same level output from
      rack-insight as the rails log is set to for the env.  It will never be more logging than Rails log's env level,
      but it can, and usually should, be less.

  * Fixed a number of bugs, and refactored some things.  Please let me know if you use it/break it!

== 0.5.0 / 2012-08-29 - transition to rack_insight (Peter Boling)

  * Compatibility

    * Restructure gem so Insight is inside a namespace, because I have classes named Insight that are obscured by
      logical_insight gem when loaded.  Logical also seemed like it may be a class name somewhere, hence going back to
      the Rack namespace a la rack-bug.  Keeping the (now nested) Insight namespace as well, because - genetics.
